However, see the more detailed overview in (Flynn 2011).\nThere are three possible sources of variation in vowel formants measurements (Ladefoged and Broadbent 1957; Pols, Tromp, and Plomp 1973: 1095; Adank 2003):\n\nacoustic variation;\nspeaker variation;\n\nsociolinguistic;\nanatomical/physiological variation;\n\nand measurement error (“residual variance” in (Pols, Tromp, and Plomp 1973)).\n\nThere are a lot of researchers aimed to reduce speaker-related variation using acoustic vowel normalization (e. g. (Gerstman 1968; Lobanov 1971; Syrdal and Gopal 1986)). However there are some researches that afraid that normalization procedures can reduce interesting for the linguistics information like sociolinguistic/dialectal signal in data (Hindle 1978; Disner 1980; Thomas 2002, 174–75).\nHuman listeners deal seemingly effortlessly with all three possible sources of variation, but the dataset from (Peterson and Barney 1952) shows extrordinary variation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Acoustic vowel normalization procedures\nThere are several classes of vowel normalization procedures:\n\nformant-based procedures (Gerstman 1968; Lobanov 1971; Fant 1975; Syrdal and Gopal 1986; Miller 1989);\nwhole-spectrum procedures (Klein, Plomp, and Pols 1970; Pols, Tromp, and Plomp 1973; Bladon and Lindblom 1981; Bladon 1982; Klatt 1982);\nNeural networks (D.

    "text": "4.3 Nasal Stops\nThe greater surface area of the vocal tract means that the walls of the vocal tract absorb more energy than in non-nasal sounds, and the greater volume of air means that the inertia of air within the vocal tract absorbs more sound as well.\n\n4.3.1 Nasal Stops: uvular ɴ\n\nWhen the uvula is lowered and the dorsum of the tongue raised to produce an uvular nasal, the vocal tract can be described as a uniform tube that is closed at the glottis and open at the nostrils.If we know the length of the tube, we can calculate its resonant frequencies, because this is a quarter-wave resonator (like the vocal tract configuration for schwa).\n(Fant 1960): 12.5 cm (the distance from the uvula to the nares) + 9 cm (the distance from the uvula to the glottis) ≈ 21.5 cm\n\nF1 = c/4L = 35000/4*21.5 = 407 Hz\nF2 = 3c/4L = 1221 Hz\nF3 = 5c/4L = 2035 Hz\nF4 = 7c/4L = 2849 Hz\n\nSince there is a velocity maximum at the nostrils each of the resonant frequencies will be lower. It is hard to make quantitative predictions about the formant frequencies of ɴ (the shape of the nasal passage varies), but the formant values will be spaced more closely in the uvular nasal than they are in ǝ\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Nasal Stops: m\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Nasal Stops: anti-resonance\nThe main difference between ɴ and m is that the mouth cavity forms a side branch in the resonant tube. The mouth cavity can be modeled as a tube closed at one end (the lips) and open at the other (the uvula) , with a length of about 9 cm. We can therefore calculate the resonances of the mouth cavity as we did for ǝ, ɴ:\n\nc/4L = 35,000 / (4 × 9) = 972\n3c/4L = 2,917 Hz\n\nThe resonant frequencies of the mouth cavity in nasals are not like that we’ve seen before: the mouth cavity is a side branch of a larger resonantor: it doesn’t open directly to the atmosphere. They are “absorbed” in the side branch anti-resonance the frequency components in m that are near the resonant frequencies of the mouth cavity are canceled, and become (anti-formants) in the acoustic output. Formants show up in the spectrum as peaks of sound energy, and anti-formants show up as pronounced spectral valleys.\n\n\n4.3.4 Nasal Stops: the main properties\n\nlow F1 (sometimes called the “nasal formant”),\nclose spacing between formants,\nthe presence of anti-formants, whose frequencies are determined by the place of articulation",

This cause longer closed phase of the glottal period and a comparably shorter open phase (and thus a smaller open quotient).\nBreathy voice — the vocal folds vibrate, but without much contact (for some people the vocal folds do not completely close during breathy voicing). So the glottis is open for a relatively long portion of each glottal cycle.

    "text": "6.3 Tone\nTone languages use fundamental frequency for contrasting words and its perceptual correlate is pitch. The tone languages are widespread, especially in Africa, Central America, and Southeast Asia (see the WALS chapter by (Maddieson 2013)). In some languages, e.g. Thai and Mandarin, tone carries a high functional load in conveying lexical contrasts, while in others, e.g. Swedish and Koasati, tone plays a more circumscribed role. Like tone, intonation is signaled through differences in fundamental frequency. Unlike tone, however, intonation is used to communicate higher level information not lexically associated with morphemes.\n\n\n\n\nAhn, M.-J. 2000. “Phonetic and Functional Bases of Syllable Weight for Stress Assignment.” University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\n\nBroselow, E., S.-I.

    "text": "8.5 speakr\nThis package allows running Praat scripts from R and it provides some wrappers for basic plotting.\nOn macOS, Linux and Windows, the path to Praat is set automatically to the default installation path. If you have installed Praat in a different location, or if your operating system is not supported, you can set the path to Praat with options(speakr.praat.path).\nFor example:\noptions(speakr.praat.path = \"./custom/praat.exe\")\nIf you use rstudio.cloud you need to upload the unziped file of Linux version of Praat and provide path to it within the options():\noptions(speakr.praat.path = \"/cloud/projects/praat\")\nYou can either run this command every time you start a new R session, or you can add the command to your .Rprofile.\nIf you run into the problem with permisions run the following command:\n\nsystem(\"chmod 700 /cloud/projects/praat\")\n\nAs an example I will use the following data:\n├── get-formants-args.praat\n├── s1_all.TextGrid\n└── s1_all.wav\nHere are the s1_all.TextGrid, s1_all.wav and the get-formants-args.praat:\nsound = Read from file: \"s1_all.wav\"\nformant = To Formant (burg): 0, 5, 5000, 0.05, 50\ntextgrid = Read from file: \"s1_all.TextGrid\"\nheader$ = \"vowel,F1,F2,F3\"\nwriteInfoLine: header$\n\nform Get formants\n    choice Measure 1\n        button Hertz\n        button Bark\n    real Window_(sec) 0.03\nendform\n\nif measure == 1\n    measure$ = \"Hertz\"\nelse\n    measure$ = \"Bark\"\nendif\n\nselectObject: textgrid\nintervals = Get number of intervals: 3\n\nfor interval to intervals - 1\n    label$ = Get label of interval: 3, interval\n    if label$ != \"\"\n        start = Get start time of interval: 3, interval\n        start = start + window\n        end = Get end time of interval: 3, interval\n        end = end - window\n        vowel$ = Get label of interval: 3, interval\n\n        selectObject: formant\n        f1 = Get mean: 1, start, end, measure$\n        f2 = Get mean: 2, start, end, measure$\n        f3 = Get mean: 3, start, end, measure$\n\n        resultLine$ = \"'vowel$','f1','f2','f3'\"\n        appendInfoLine: resultLine$\n        selectObject: textgrid\n    endif\nendfor\nIn order to use it you need to provide path to the script:\n\nlibrary(speakr)\npraat_run(\"sounds/speakr/get-formants-args.praat\", \n          \"Hertz\", 0.03, capture = TRUE)\n\n[1] \"vowel,F1,F2,F3\\na,832.4811706103461,1530.407550923205,2174.8142766925444\\na,775.5008460543343,1368.2559214263936,2509.0842739358327\\na,833.9754786129074,1430.990992307002,2375.2400438444165\\na,863.5056579489489,1546.885742911334,2890.4894666926434\\nə,723.6246285090019,1689.4018385005436,2873.199185801066\\nə,717.2752835271837,1675.2061788632182,2745.558475291998\\nə,758.8974774309055,1679.0831366099853,2698.9562863172\\nə,711.4372164545807,1685.113736085277,3031.596369149418\"\n\n\nAs you see the result is file in a .csv format.
